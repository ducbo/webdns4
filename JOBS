# Jobs

## add_domain

Add domain to bind as slave (master: webdns). It uses the `/usr/sbin/rndc
addzone` interface.

## trigger_event

Trigger an event for the specified domain through the WebDNS API. The state
machine will take care of the rest once the event is received, it usually
changes state and pushes more jobs to the queue.

## opendnssec_add

Add a zone to opendnssec for signing. The zone is transfered from WebDNS
and a signed zone file is created to `/var/lib/opendnssec/signed` (should be
symlinked to '/var/cache/bind/webdns').

## bind_convert_to_dnssed

It checks that the signed zone file exists and triggers a 'rndc delzone'
followed by 'rnd addzone' that serves the signed zone as a master (file
"webdns/signed/%{zone}").

## wait_for_ready_to_push_ds

Wait for KSK to become ready so we can publish the DS records to the parent
authority.

## publish_ds

Pushes the DS records to the parent depending on the parent authority.

## wait_for_active

Wait for the KSK to become active. The KSK is marked active by the ds-monitor
script. ds-monitor checks if the DS records are visible using the local
recursor.

## remove_domain

Remove a zone from bind using rndc delzone.

## opendnssec_remove

Remove a zone from ods uning 'ods-ksmutil zone delete'.
